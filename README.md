CONTENT:
- Display the data for at least 2 of the end-points in the API
- Include navigation from each end-point's page to the other end-points that are displayed
- Issue new GET requests for the linked data to display in the linked pages.

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Be sure that we can get the code to run without issues by following the instructions in the README file
- Be sure navigation between the different end-points behaves properly and is not slowed down by requesting more data than needs to be displayed
- Be sure your code is readable and well structured
- If including a user-interactive feature like a search field, be sure that you appropriately handle error cases
- Be thoughtful about what type of styling is used (example: font-sizes are not too small or large, colors are not too dark/light to be easily seen, etc.)
