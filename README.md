# Star Wars Universe Explorer

[Visit Deployed App](https://ctd-starwars.netlify.app/)

### CONTENT:
- Display the data for at least 2 of the end-points in the API
- Include navigation from each end-point's page to the other end-points that are displayed
- Issue new GET requests for the linked data to display in the linked pages.

### FUNCTIONALITY:
- Be sure that we can get the code to run without issues by following the instructions in the README file
- Be sure navigation between the different end-points behaves properly and is not slowed down by requesting more data than needs to be displayed
- Be sure your code is readable and well structured
- If including a user-interactive feature like a search field, be sure that you appropriately handle error cases
- Be thoughtful about what type of styling is used (example: font-sizes are not too small or large, colors are not too dark/light to be easily seen, etc.)

### Tech tasks:
- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router DOM
- Tailwind CSS
- React Scroll
- SWAPI.tech API

### Tasks
+ [x] React router implementation (react-router-dom)
+ [x] Cover scroll routing (react-scroll)
+ [x] Handle 404 redirects
+ [ ] Lazy load ?
+ [x] Page redirection
+ [x] Content
+ [x] Upd load animation
+ [x] Cover films ID overflow (404)
+ [x] Cover all redirects between data units
+ [ ] Basic responsiveness
+ [x] Upd icon + info

Good idea to add resonsiveness, reusable components, lazy load and image size optimizations.
